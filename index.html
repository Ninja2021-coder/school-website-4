Beyond its innovative hub, students from Emlyon shall have access to the whole range of facilities (classrooms, library, and laboratories) of this 12,000m2 campus. At first, this pedagogical platform shall serve 250 Indo-French students. With a common vision, both institutions agree on the necessity to hybridize competences, but also the importance to train responsible students able to address social and environmental issues. Just like Emlyon, St Xavier’s College is a 150 year-old renowned institution, a multi-disciplinary college counting over 3,000 students today.</p>

                        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">St Xavier’s University has postponed the Xavier Law Admission Test (XLAT) that was to be held on April 25 till further notice “considering the current pandemic situation”. The computer-based tests were to be held in nine cities, including Calcutta. Considering the fresh wave of Covid-19 cases that are being reported across the country, exposure at the test venues could be unsafe for the candidates and so, the tests have been postponed, said an official of the university. Apart from Calcutta, the tests were to be held in Mumbai, Delhi, Siliguri, Durgapur, Guwahati, Ranchi, Patna and Bhubaneswar. The entrance tests are conducted for admission to BA-LLB (Honours) and BCom-LLB (Honours), both five-year degree programmes, run by St Xavier’s Law School. On April 25, two slots had been fixed for the multiple-choice admission tests of 100 marks each for the two programmes. “It would not be advisable to ask the candidates to step out of their homes and reach the venues to appear for the tests. The situation is grim in cities like Delhi and Mumbai. There the citizens are not stepping out of their homes until and unless it is a health emergency. The condition is bad in other cities as well,” said Father Felix Raj, the vice-chancellor of the university. For the computer-based tests, the law aspirants go to a centre where they are given terminals to write the tests under the watch of invigilators, an official of the university said. The test proceedings are also recorded on camera. “Issues like whether the centres have been sanitised properly, the risk of using public transport or any means of transport on the way to the centre are bound to trigger worries…. There is a crisis of beds in hospitals and oxygen support to treat Covid patients,” the official said. Asked if the tests can be held online so that candidates can write them from home, Father Felix Raj said the Bar Council of India had specified that the tests had to be conducted in the computer-based or physical pen-and-paper mode. “We will announce the next course of action depending on how the situation evolves. Candidates will be kept posted,” he said. Classes for the two courses are supposed to begin in July. Students who have passed Plus-II exams and who are not older than 20 years are eligible to apply for the admission test.</p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Rabindranath Tagore was an Indian polymath - poet, writer, playwright, composer, philosopher, social reformer and painter. He reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of the "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse" of Gitanjali, He became in 1913 the first non-European as well as the first lyricist to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of Bengal". A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district and Jessore, Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old. At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"), which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics. By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas, published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent anti-nationalist, he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain. As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; his legacy also endures in the institution he founded, Visva-Bharati University. Tagore modernised Bengali art by spurning rigid classical forms and resisting linguistic strictures. His novels, stories, songs, dance-dramas, and essays spoke to topics political and personal. Gitanjali (Song Offerings), Gora (Fair-Faced) and Ghare-Baire (The Home and the World) are his best-known works, and his verse, short stories, and novels were acclaimed—or panned—for their lyricism, colloquialism, naturalism, and unnatural contemplation. His compositions were chosen by two nations as national anthems: India's "Jana Gana Mana" and Bangladesh's "Amar Shonar Bangla". The Sri Lankan national anthem was inspired by his work. <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore" target="_blank">LINK</b></a></p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose was a biologist, physicist, botanist and an early writer of science fiction. He pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian subcontinent. IEEE named him one of the fathers of radio science. Bose is considered the father of Bengali science fiction, and also invented the crescograph, a device for measuring the growth of plants. A crater on the moon has been named in his honour. He founded Bose Institute, a premier research institute of India and also one of its oldest. Established in 1917, the Institute was the first interdisciplinary research centre in Asia. He served as the Director of Bose Institute from its inception until his death. Born in Munshiganj, Bengal Presidency, during British governance of India (now in Bangladesh), Bose graduated from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta (now Kolkata, West Bengal, India). He went to the University of London, England to study medicine, but could not pursue studies in medicine because of health problems. Instead, he conducted his research with the Nobel Laureate Lord Rayleigh at Cambridge and returned to India. He joined the Presidency College of the University of Calcutta as a professor of physics. There, despite racial discrimination and a lack of funding and equipment, Bose carried on his scientific research. He made remarkable progress in his research of remote wireless signalling and was the first to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals. However, instead of trying to gain commercial benefit from this invention, Bose made his inventions public in order to allow others to further develop his research. Bose subsequently made a number of pioneering discoveries in plant physiology. He used his own invention, the crescograph, to measure plant response to various stimuli, and thereby scientifically proved parallelism between animal and plant tissues. Although Bose filed for a patent for one of his inventions because of peer pressure, his objection to any form of patenting was well known. To facilitate his research, he constructed automatic recorders capable of registering extremely slight movements; these instruments produced some striking results, such as quivering of injured plants, which Bose interpreted as a power of feeling in plants. His books include Response in the Living and Non-Living (1902) and The Nervous Mechanism of Plants (1926). In a 2004 BBC poll, Bose was voted seventh Greatest Bengali of all time.<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagadish_Chandra_Bose" target="_blank">LINK</b></a></p>
